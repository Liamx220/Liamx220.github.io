        <h2>📜 Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify them or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things.

        <h2>🙂 Who am I</h2>

       
        <p>
          I am a high school student from Canada who has a passion for computers and programming. I hope to work for the Canadian Space Agency as an embedded systems engineer. I mainly made this website so I could practice my font-end web development skills. When I’m not at my computer I can be found playing baseball and walking my dog.
