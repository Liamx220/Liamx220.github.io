        <p>With Mycenae being considered the first civilization of Greece it left quite the obvious impression on the area. The mycenaeans were the people who created and first spoke the Greek language. Their existence outlives that of the golden age Greece by nearly 1000 years. Housing around 30,000 people it was a large city for the time that survived with its great trading systems, small technological innovations and noble army. Like essentially all of Greece at the time their men were strong individuals who lived to serve their state. Wither in the army or in trade.

        <p>But is the area like now? Well Mycenae was essentially destroyed in the bronze age. Around the year 1100 BC. The exact reason for the collapse is still debated, in a way like the Mesopotamians. Itâ€™s usually attributed towards inviting rival civilizations or internal conflicts/a general move out of the city. No matter the outcome now Mycenae essentially lies as a city of ruins. Most of the current activity in the area is around the archaeological excavation of the area for historical purposes.

The city has gained many mentions from Homer in his many texts but modernly it is mainly interpreted as the early stages of Greece and the civilisation and practiced many of the things that ancient Greece became famous for. Being one of the earliest forms of the country, Mycenae has its impact on the modern world through the subtle ways it influenced the culture of ancient and now modern Greece with things like religious practices, values, language and traditions. It's a state that although not the most famous ancient location in Greece, one that's important in understanding its identity as a country nowadays.
