        <p>When visiting Mycenae in the current day it is definitely worth visiting the Treasury of Atreus. Also known as the Tomb of Agamemnon, the large tholos (false dome) tomb was built between 1400-1200 BC for the former king of Mycenae. With food and water to help guide him in his journey through the underworld. The near 50 feet tomb in diameter dome is a fantastic representation of the value and application of architecture in ancient Greece with firm stone walls that have stood throughout millennia. With the Treasury of Atreus offering a unique opportunity to witness the creativity and skill of ancient builders. This famous location will further your understanding of their existence by giving insight to their religion and beliefs mainly on the afterlife. With things like the food left by the place of burial showing their beliefs of physical items being taken into the afterlife as an example. Even the way the building is constructed with the circular design speculated to have meant representation of the sun and the arches to heaven. With the entrance facing the rising sun symbolizing rebirth after death. Overall this place is canâ€™t miss if you ever take the trip to Greece.
